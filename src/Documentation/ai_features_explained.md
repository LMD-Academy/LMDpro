# AI Features in LMDpro

LMDpro leverages advanced Artificial Intelligence, powered by Google's Gemini API, to enhance your learning experience and provide dynamic content generation capabilities. This document explains some of the key AI-driven features you'll encounter.

## 1. AI-Powered Search & Dynamic Course Generation

LMDpro's search functionality is designed to help you find exactly what you're looking for. If you search for a course or topic that isn't currently in our extensive catalog, our AI steps in to assist you.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Initial Search:** When you enter a search query, the system first looks through our existing curated courses and content.
2.  **AI Course Creation:** If a direct match isn't found, LMDpro utilizes the Gemini API to dynamically generate a new course outline tailored to your search query. This process involves:
    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The AI analyzes your search query to understand the underlying intent and subject matter.
    *   **Content Synthesis (Guided by LMDpro's Framework):** The AI draws upon its vast knowledge base to create a relevant and structured course. To ensure the generated content aligns with LMDpro's pedagogical standards and structure, the AI is provided with specific system instructions derived from two key LMDpro documents:
        *   `./course_structure.json` (referring to the overall structure patterns defined therein): This document provides the AI with guidelines on how LMDpro courses are typically structured, including the hierarchy of Fields, Standalone Courses, and Sub-Courses (modules). It outlines preferred pedagogical approaches, content organization, and desired learning outcomes.
        *   `./assessment_structure.md`: This document informs the AI about the types of assessments, quizzes, and learning checks typically associated with LMDpro courses. This guidance helps the AI generate module overviews that implicitly consider how knowledge might be assessed and ensure that the generated content is conducive to creating effective learning checks.
    *   **Course Outline Generation:** Based on your query and these guiding principles, the AI constructs:
        *   An appropriate **Field** (either new or an existing one if relevant).
        *   A new **Standalone Course** complete with an overview, suggested difficulty level, and estimated length.
        *   Several **Sub-Courses (Modules)** within that Standalone Course, each with its own overview, difficulty, length, and ideas for potential learning objectives. For now, these modules primarily contain AI-generated overviews. The file paths for these generated sub-courses will be unique and follow a pattern like `Study/AI_Generated/Field_ID/Standalone_Course_ID/Modules/module_title_slug.md`.
3.  **Integration:** The newly generated course structure is seamlessly integrated into LMDpro's `courseDataStore`.
4.  **Availability:** You will see a status message indicating that the AI is generating the course, and once complete, it will appear in the **Course Catalog** (often highlighted as new) and become selectable in the **Library** for further exploration.

**Example:** If you search for "Quantum Entanglement for Business Leaders," and no such course exists, the AI will attempt to create a course structure with relevant modules explaining this complex topic in a business context, guided by LMDpro's educational framework documents.

**Benefits:**
*   **Relevant Learning:** Get access to learning material on virtually any topic you search for.
*   **Structured Content:** AI-generated courses follow LMDpro's pedagogical structure, thanks to the guiding documents.
*   **Immediate Availability:** New course outlines become available quickly, expanding your learning horizons.

## 2. AI Assistant (Chat)

Our AI Assistant is available to answer your questions, explain concepts, summarize module content, and provide general learning support. It uses the Gemini API to understand your queries and provide informative responses.

## 3. AI-Enhanced Module View

Within the "Module View," you'll find AI-powered enhancements for each paragraph of your learning material:
*   **Paragraph Audio (Conceptual):** Listen to an AI-generated narration of the current paragraph. (UI will be present).
*   **Paragraph Illustration (Conceptual):** View an AI-generated image relevant to the current paragraph's content, helping to visualize concepts. (UI will be present).

## 4. Library & Research AI Tools

In the "Library" section, when you load a sub-course:
*   **AI Summary:** Get a concise AI-generated summary of the full sub-course content.
*   **Research Companion:**
    *   **Find Publications:** Uses Google Search grounding via the Gemini API to find relevant scholarly articles based on your keywords.
    *   **Identify Trends:** The AI analyzes the found publications to identify emerging themes and trends.
*   **AI Demos:** Run live demonstrations of Gemini API capabilities.

LMDpro is committed to leveraging AI to provide a rich, adaptive, and personalized learning journey. We are continuously exploring new ways to integrate AI responsibly to enhance educational outcomes.
