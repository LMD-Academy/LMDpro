# Module 3.2.CY: Network Security Fundamentals

**Level:** 3 (Professional - Specialization)
**Major:** Cybersecurity (CY)

**Estimated Content Length:** 15-25 A4 Pages

**Prerequisites:** Module 3.1.CY (Introduction to Cybersecurity & Threats), Basic understanding of computer networks (Module 3.3.CS is beneficial).

**Learning Objectives (Illustrative):**
*   Understand common network topologies and their security implications.
*   Identify key network protocols (TCP/IP suite) and associated vulnerabilities.
*   Learn about network security devices (firewalls, IDS/IPS, routers, switches) and their roles.
*   Implement basic network segmentation and access control strategies.
*   Understand wireless network security principles and common threats (e.g., WPA2/3, rogue APs).
*   Explore concepts of VPNs, DMZs, and network monitoring.
*   Develop foundational knowledge for securing network infrastructure.

**Key Topics to be Covered (Illustrative):**
*   **Networking Fundamentals Review:**
    *   OSI and TCP/IP models.
    *   IP addressing (IPv4, IPv6 basics), Subnetting.
    *   Common protocols: TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, DNS, HTTP/S, FTP, SMTP.
*   **Network Security Devices:**
    *   **Firewalls:** Packet filtering, stateful inspection, Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs), Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Rule configuration basics.
    *   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) & Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Signature-based vs. anomaly-based detection, NIDS vs. HIDS.
    *   **Routers & Switches:** Basic security configurations (ACLs on routers, port security on switches).
    *   **Proxies and Gateways.**
*   **Network Design for Security:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Creating isolated network zones (e.g., DMZ, internal LANs, guest networks) to limit attack surface and impact. VLANs.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Layered security approach.
    *   **Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT).**
*   **Wireless Network Security:**
    *   Wi-Fi security protocols: WEP (obsolete), WPA, WPA2, WPA3. Authentication methods (PSK, EAP).
    *   Common wireless threats: Rogue access points, evil twins, deauthentication attacks, KRACK.
    *   Best practices for securing WLANs.
*   **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):**
    *   Purpose and types (site-to-site, remote access).
    *   Common VPN protocols (IPsec, SSL/TLS VPNs).
*   **Network Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   Importance of network traffic analysis and log collection.
    *   Introduction to tools like Wireshark, NetFlow/sFlow.
    *   SIEM basics for correlating network events.
*   **Common Network Attacks (Deeper Dive):**
    *   DoS/DDoS mitigation techniques.
    *   ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning.
    *   Network reconnaissance (ping sweeps, port scanning).
*   **Securing Network Protocols:**
    *   DNSSEC, HTTPS, SSH, SFTP.
