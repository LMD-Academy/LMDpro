# Module 4.1.CY: Advanced Network Security & Cryptography

**Level:** 4 (Senior / Extremely Advanced)
**Major:** Cybersecurity (CY)

**Estimated Content Length:** 18-25+ A4 Pages

**Prerequisites:** Module 3.1.CY (Introduction to Cybersecurity & Threats), Module 3.2.CY (Network Security Fundamentals), Module 3.3.CY (Cryptography Basics & Applications)

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Design and implement defense-in-depth network security architectures.
*   Analyze advanced network protocols and their security implications (e.g., BGP, DNSSEC, IPv6 security).
*   Master configuration and management of advanced security devices (e.g., NGFWs, WAFs, IDPS).
*   Understand advanced wireless security mechanisms and attacks (e.g., WPA3, EAP, rogue AP detection).
*   Apply modern cryptographic techniques and understand their mathematical foundations (e.g., AES modes, ECC, SHA-3).
*   Design and manage Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificate services.
*   Analyze common cryptographic attacks and countermeasures.
*   Explore emerging cryptographic concepts (e.g., post-quantum cryptography awareness).
