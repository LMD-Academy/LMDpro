# Module 4.1.CS: Advanced Algorithms & Complexity

**Level:** 4 (Senior / Extremely Advanced)
**Major:** Computer Science (CS)

**Estimated Content Length:** 18-25+ A4 Pages

**Prerequisites:** Module 3.1.CS (Programming Fundamentals & Paradigms), Module 3.2.CS (Data Structures & Algorithms), Module 3.3.CS (Operating Systems & Concurrency)

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Master advanced algorithm design techniques (dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, network flow, linear programming).
*   Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using asymptotic notation (Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta) and recurrence relations.
*   Understand the theory of NP-completeness and its implications.
*   Explore approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.
*   Analyze randomized algorithms and their performance guarantees.
*   Understand advanced data structures (e.g., Fibonacci heaps, B-trees, suffix trees/arrays).
*   Explore algorithms for specialized domains (e.g., computational geometry, string matching, cryptography basics).
