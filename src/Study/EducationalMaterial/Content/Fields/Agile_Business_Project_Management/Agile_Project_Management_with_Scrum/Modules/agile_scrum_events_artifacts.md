# Sub-Course: Scrum Events and Artifacts

**Level:** Intermediate
**Parent Course:** Agile_Project_Management_with_Scrum (AGILE_SCRUM)
**Parent Field:** Agile_Business_and_Project_Management (AGILE_PM)

**Estimated Content Length:** 15-20 A4 Pages (Approx. 5 hours of study)

**Learning Objectives:**
*   Understand the purpose, time-box, and participants for each of the five Scrum events: The Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
*   Describe the three official Scrum artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment, and understand their associated commitments (Product Goal, Sprint Goal, Definition of Done).
*   Explain the concept of the Definition of Done (DoD) and its critical importance in ensuring transparency and quality.
*   Analyze how transparency, inspection, and adaptation (the pillars of empiricism) are enabled and supported through Scrum events and artifacts.
*   Understand the flow of work and information as facilitated by these events and artifacts.

## 1. Introduction: The Rhythmic Heartbeat and Transparent Information of Scrum

Scrum is an empirical process framework, meaning it relies on transparency, inspection, and adaptation to navigate complexity and deliver value. The Scrum events provide the rhythm and opportunities for this empiricism to occur, creating regular cadences for planning, synchronization, feedback, and improvement. The Scrum artifacts, on the other hand, represent work or value and are designed to maximize the transparency of key information, providing a shared understanding for everyone involved. Together, the events and artifacts form the core structure and operational mechanics of the Scrum framework.

This module delves into the specifics of the five Scrum events and the three official Scrum artifacts, including their associated commitments. We will explore the purpose, typical duration (time-box), and participants for The Sprint itself, Sprint Planning, the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective. You will gain a deep understanding of the Product Backlog (and its Product Goal), the Sprint Backlog (and its Sprint Goal), and the Increment (and its Definition of Done). A critical focus will be on how these elements work synergistically to enable the empirical pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation, fostering a continuous cycle of learning and value delivery. Understanding the "what, why, and who" of each event and artifact is fundamental to effectively implementing and participating in Scrum.

## 2. The Scrum Events: Opportunities for Inspection and Adaptation

Scrum prescribes five formal events, contained within the Sprint itself, designed to create regularity and minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed, meaning they have a maximum duration, which ensures an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.

**A. The Sprint:**
*   **Purpose:** The heartbeat of Scrum, a container for all other events. During the Sprint, a "Done," usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.
*   **Time-box:** One month or less. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
*   **Key Characteristics During a Sprint:**
    *   No changes are made that would endanger the **Sprint Goal**.
    *   Quality goals do not
