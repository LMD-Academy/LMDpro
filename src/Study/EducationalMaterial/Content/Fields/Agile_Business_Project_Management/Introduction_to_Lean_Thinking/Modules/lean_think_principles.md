    4.  **Establish Pull:** As flow is introduced, let customers pull value from the next upstream activity.
    5.  **Pursue Perfection:** As value is specified, value streams are identified, wasted steps are removed, and flow and pull are introduced, begin the process again and continue it until a state of perfection is reached in which perfect value is created with no waste.
