# LMDpro Production Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Your LMDpro app is now ready for production deployment!

The build has been successfully completed. Follow this guide to deploy your app to www.lmdpro.com.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended - Easiest)

Vercel is the platform created by the Next.js team and offers the best experience for Next.js apps.

#### Steps:
1. **Create Vercel Account**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up
2. **Connect GitHub**: 
   - Push your code to GitHub first
   - Connect your GitHub account to Vercel
3. **Import Project**:
   - In Vercel dashboard, click "Import Project"
   - Select your LMDpro repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it's a Next.js app
4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.lmdpro.com
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
5. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy" - Vercel will build and deploy automatically
6. **Get IP Address**: After deployment, go to your project settings â†’ Domains
7. **Add Custom Domain**: Add `www.lmdpro.com` in the domains section

**Your IP will be**: Vercel provides multiple IPs, but you'll get an A record like `76.76.19.61`

### Option 2: Railway (Good Alternative)

1. **Sign up**: Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Deploy from GitHub**: Connect your repo
3. **Environment Variables**: Add the same variables as above
4. **Custom Domain**: Add www.lmdpro.com in Railway settings

### Option 3: DigitalOcean App Platform

1. **Create Account**: [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform)
2. **Create App**: Connect GitHub repository
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure in app settings
4. **Custom Domain**: Point to your domain

## DNS Configuration on ONE.com

Once you choose a hosting provider and get the IP address, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Log into ONE.com
1. Go to [one.com](https://www.one.com)
2. Log into your account
3. Navigate to "My Products" â†’ "Domain names"

### Step 2: DNS Management
1. Click on your domain `lmdpro.com`
2. Go to "DNS settings" or "Advanced DNS"

### Step 3: Configure DNS Records

Add these DNS records:

```
Type    Name    Value                   TTL
A       @       [YOUR_HOST_IP]         300
A       www     [YOUR_HOST_IP]         300
CNAME   *       www.lmdpro.com         300
```

**Replace `[YOUR_HOST_IP]` with the IP address from your hosting provider.**

### Example (if using Vercel):
```
Type    Name    Value               TTL
A       @       76.76.19.61        300
A       www     76.76.19.61        300
CNAME   *       www.lmdpro.com     300
```

### Step 4: Wait for Propagation
- DNS changes take 24-48 hours to propagate globally
- You can check propagation status at [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)

## Environment Variables Needed

Create a `.env.production` file with these variables:

```env
# Required for AI features
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here

# Site configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.lmdpro.com
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional: Database (if you add one later)
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string

# Optional: Analytics
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id
```

## SSL Certificate

Your hosting provider (Vercel, Railway, etc.) will automatically provide SSL certificates for your custom domain. This means your site will be accessible via HTTPS.

## Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Site loads at https://www.lmdpro.com
- [ ] All pages work correctly
- [ ] AI assistant functionality works
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Loading speed (should be fast)
- [ ] SSL certificate is active (green lock in browser)

## Monitoring & Maintenance

1. **Uptime Monitoring**: Use services like UptimeRobot or Pingdom
2. **Analytics**: Set up Google Analytics
3. **Error Monitoring**: Consider Sentry for error tracking
4. **Performance**: Monitor with Vercel Analytics or similar

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **DNS not resolving**: Wait longer for propagation (up to 48 hours)
2. **SSL certificate issues**: Contact your hosting provider
3. **Environment variables**: Double-check they're set correctly
4. **Build failures**: Check the deployment logs in your hosting dashboard

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test thoroughly**: Go through all app features
2. **Set up monitoring**: Uptime and error monitoring
3. **Configure analytics**: Track user behavior
4. **Regular backups**: Set up automated backups if using database
5. **Performance optimization**: Monitor and optimize as needed

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check hosting provider documentation
2. Review deployment logs
3. Test locally first with `npm run build && npm start`
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
