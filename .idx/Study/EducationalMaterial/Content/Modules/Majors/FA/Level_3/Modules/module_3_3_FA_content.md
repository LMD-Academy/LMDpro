## 1. Introduction: Making Sound Financial Decisions for the Firm

Corporate finance is concerned with the financial decisions that businesses make and the tools and analysis used to make these decisions. Its primary goal is to maximize shareholder value (or firm value) through effective financial planning and execution. This involves three main areas of decision-making: investment decisions (what long-term assets to invest in – capital budgeting), financing decisions (how to raise capital to fund those investments – capital structure), and working capital management decisions (managing short-term assets and liabilities). A crucial underpinning for many of these decisions is business valuation – determining the economic worth of a company or an asset.

This module, the third in the Finance & Accounting specialization, builds upon your understanding of financial statement analysis, budgeting, and forecasting. We will delve into the core principles of **capital budgeting**, learning how to evaluate potential investment projects using techniques like Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the Payback Period. Understanding a company's **cost of capital**, particularly the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), is essential for these investment decisions, and we will explore its calculation and significance. We will then examine different sources of long-term **financing** – primarily debt and equity – and discuss their characteristics and implications for the firm. A significant focus will be on introducing the fundamental approaches to **business valuation**, including the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method and valuation using market comparables (multiples). We will also cover the essentials of **working capital management**, which involves managing the firm's short-term assets (like cash, receivables, inventory) and liabilities (like payables) to ensure smooth operations and liquidity. Finally, we will introduce foundational concepts of financial **risk and return** and the basics of how companies decide on their optimal **capital structure** (mix of debt and equity). Mastering these corporate finance and valuation basics is critical for finance professionals involved in financial planning, investment analysis, and strategic decision-making.

## 2. Capital Budgeting: Evaluating Investment Projects

Capital budgeting (or investment appraisal) is the process that companies use for decision-making on long-term investment projects, such as purchasing new machinery, building new plants, or launching new products. These decisions are critical because they often involve large expenditures and have long-term consequences.

**A. Identifying Relevant Cash Flows:**
*   Focus on **incremental cash flows**: The additional cash flows (inflows and outflows) that will occur if the project is undertaken, compared to if it's not. This is the "with-versus-without" principle.
*   Consider **initial investment** (cash outflow at the start, e.g., purchase price, installation costs, initial working capital).
*   Estimate **operating cash flows** over the project's life (annual cash inflows from revenues minus annual cash outflows for expenses, adjusted for taxes and non-cash charges like depreciation if using an indirect method to arrive at operating cash flow).
*   Account for **terminal cash flow** (cash flow at the end of the project, e.g., salvage value of assets, recovery of net working capital, tax implications on asset disposal).
*   **Ignore sunk costs:** Costs already incurred in the past that cannot be recovered, regardless of whether the project is accepted or rejected. They are irrelevant to the decision.
*   **Include opportunity costs:** The value of the best alternative foregone by choosing a particular project.
*   Consider the impact on **net working capital (NWC)**: Projects often require an investment in NWC (e.g., increased inventory or receivables). This initial investment is typically recovered at the end of the project.

**B. Evaluation Techniques:**

1.  **Net Present Value (NPV):**
    *   **Concept:** Calculates the present value of all expected future incremental cash flows from a project (both inflows and outflows) by discounting them back to the present using a required rate of return (usually the WACC).
    *   **Formula:** `NPV = Σ [CFt / (1+k)ᵗ] - CF₀`
        *   `CFt` = Net incremental cash flow in period `t`
        *   `CF₀` = Initial investment (a negative value)
        *   `k` = Discount rate (cost of capital / WACC)
        *   `t` = Time period (from 1 to N, where N is the project life)
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   If `NPV > 0`, accept the project (it's expected to increase firm value).
        *   If `NPV < 0`, reject the project.
        *   If `NPV = 0`, indifferent (project earns exactly the required rate of return).
    *   **Pros:** Considers the time value of money, uses all cash flows of the project, provides a direct measure of the expected increase in firm value. Generally considered the theoretically best method.
    *   **Cons:** Requires an accurate estimate of the discount rate and future cash flows, which can be challenging.

2.  **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**
    *   **Concept:** The discount rate at which the NPV of a project equals zero. It represents the project's effective compounded rate of return.
    *   **Decision Rule:**
        *   If `IRR > WACC` (hurdle rate), accept the project.
        *   If `IRR < WACC`, reject the project.
    *   **Pros:** Considers the time value of money, uses all cash flows, intuitive (expressed as a percentage return).
    *   **Cons:** Can be difficult to calculate manually (requires iteration or financial calculator/software), may yield multiple IRRs or no IRR for non-conventional cash flows (multiple sign changes in cash flows), can lead to incorrect ranking of mutually exclusive projects if their scales or timing of cash flows differ significantly (NPV is preferred in such cases).

3.  **Payback Period:**
    *   **Concept:** The length of time it takes for a project's cumulative net cash inflows to equal its initial investment.
    *   **Decision Rule:** Accept if the payback period is less than a predetermined maximum acceptable period set by management.
    *   **Pros:** Simple to understand and calculate, provides an indication of project liquidity and risk (faster payback implies quicker cash recovery and less risk exposure over time).
    *   **Cons:** Ignores the time value of money, ignores cash flows beyond the payback period (thus not a measure of overall profitability), biased against long-term projects, arbitrary cutoff period. Often used as a supplementary screening tool rather than a primary decision criterion.

4.  **Discounted Payback Period:** Similar to the payback period, but uses discounted cash flows. Addresses the time value of money issue but still ignores cash flows after the discounted payback period.

5.  **Profitability Index (PI) or Benefit-Cost Ratio:**
    *   **Concept:** Ratio of the present value of future cash inflows to the initial investment.
    *   **Formula:** `PI = (PV of Future Cash Inflows) / |Initial Investment|` or `PI = (NPV + |Initial Investment|) / |Initial Investment| = 1 + (NPV / |Initial Investment|)`
    *   **Decision Rule:** If `PI > 1`, accept the project.
    *   **Pros:** Considers the time value of money, useful for ranking projects when capital is rationed (select projects with highest PI).

NPV is generally preferred for its direct link to shareholder wealth maximization.

## 3. Cost of Capital (WACC)

The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return a company must earn on its investments to satisfy its investors (both debt and equity holders). It represents the opportunity cost of funds. The most common measure is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

*   **Definition:** WACC is the average rate of return a company needs to earn to provide a return to all its security holders (debt holders, preferred stockholders, common stockholders) in proportion to their contribution to the company's capital.
*   **Formula:**
    `WACC = (Weight of Equity * Cost of Equity) + (Weight of Debt * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)) + (Weight of Preferred Stock * Cost of Preferred Stock)`
    `WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1-Tc)) + (P/V * Rp)`
    Where:
        *   `E` = Market value of the firm's equity
        *   `D` = Market value of the firm's debt
        *   `P` = Market value of the firm's preferred stock
        *   `V = E + D + P` (Total market value of the firm's financing)
        *   `Re` = Cost of Equity
        *   `Rd` = Cost of Debt (pre-tax)
        *   `Rp` = Cost of Preferred Stock
        *   `Tc` = Corporate Tax Rate
*   **Components:**
    *   **Cost of Equity (Re):** The return required by equity investors. Often estimated using:
        *   *Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):* `Re = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Risk Premium)`
        *   *Dividend Discount Model (DDM):* `Re = (D1 / P0) + g` (where D1 is expected dividend, P0 is current stock price, g is dividend growth rate).
    *   **Cost of Debt (Rd):** The effective interest rate a company pays on its debt. Can be estimated from the yield to maturity (YTM) on existing long-term debt or by looking at interest rates for newly issued debt with similar risk. *Interest payments are tax-deductible, so the after-tax cost of debt is `Rd * (1 - Tc)`.*
    *   **Cost of Preferred Stock (Rp):** The dividend paid on preferred stock divided by its current market price. `Rp = Dp / Pp`.
    *   **Weights (E/V, D/V, P/V):** Proportions of each type of financing in the company's target capital structure, typically based on market values.
*   **Use:** WACC is commonly used as the discount rate in capital budgeting (NPV calculations) for projects with average risk similar to the company's overall risk profile. For projects with significantly different risk, an adjusted discount rate may be necessary.

## 4. Sources of Long-Term Financing

Companies use a mix of long-term financing to fund their operations and investments.
*   **Debt Financing:** Borrowing money that must be repaid with interest.
    *   *Examples:* Bank loans, corporate bonds, notes payable.
    *   *Pros:* Interest payments are tax-deductible (tax shield), owners retain full ownership (no dilution of equity), debt holders typically don't have voting rights.
    *   *Cons:* Fixed obligation to pay interest and principal (increases financial risk/risk of bankruptcy if payments can't be made), restrictive covenants in debt agreements, too much debt can make it harder to obtain additional financing.
*   **Equity Financing:** Selling ownership stakes (shares) in the company.
    *   *Examples:* Issuing common stock (to public via IPO or private placements), preferred stock, retained earnings (reinvesting profits).
    *   *Pros:* No fixed repayment obligation for common equity (dividends are discretionary for common stock), provides a permanent capital base, can improve creditworthiness.
    *   *Cons:* Dilutes existing owners' control and share of profits, dividends are not tax-deductible, cost of equity is generally higher than cost of debt (due to higher risk for equity investors).
*   **Preferred Stock:** A hybrid security with characteristics of both debt and equity. Pays a fixed dividend (like debt interest), but failure to pay dividends doesn't lead to bankruptcy (like equity). Preferred dividends are typically cumulative. Ranks senior to common stock but junior to debt in claims on assets.

The mix of debt and equity a company uses is its **capital structure**.

## 5. Business Valuation Basics

Business valuation is the process of determining the economic worth of a business or company unit.
**A. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis:**
*   **Concept:** Values a business based on the present value of its expected future free cash flows (FCF).
    *   **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** Cash flow available to all investors (debt and equity holders) after covering operating expenses and capital expenditures. Discounted at WACC.
    *   **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):** Cash flow available to equity holders after all expenses, debt payments (interest and principal), and capital expenditures. Discounted at the Cost of Equity (Re).
*   **Steps (Simplified FCFF Approach):**
    1.  Forecast future FCFFs for a projection period (e.g., 5-10 years).
    2.  Estimate a terminal value (TV) representing the value of cash flows beyond the projection period (e.g., using Gordon Growth Model or an exit multiple).
    3.  Discount the forecasted FCFFs and the TV back to the present using the WACC to get the Enterprise Value (EV).
    4.  `Enterprise Value = PV(FCFFs) + PV(Terminal Value)`
    5.  To get Equity Value: `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Market Value of Debt - Value of Preferred Stock + Cash & Cash Equivalents`.
*   **Pros:** Theoretically sound, focuses on cash flow generation, adaptable to different scenarios.
*   **Cons:** Highly sensitive to assumptions (growth rates, discount rate, terminal value), forecasting future cash flows accurately is challenging.

**B. Comparable Company Analysis (Trading Multiples):**
*   **Concept:** Values a company by comparing it to similar publicly traded companies based on market valuation multiples.
*   **Common Multiples:**
    *   *Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:* `Market Price per Share / Earnings Per Share`
    *   *Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA):* `Enterprise Value / Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization`
    *   *Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:* `Market Capitalization / Total Revenue`
    *   *Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:* `Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share`
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Identify a set of comparable publicly traded companies (similar industry, size, risk, growth prospects).
    2.  Calculate relevant valuation multiples for these comparable companies.
    3.  Calculate a benchmark multiple (e.g., average or median of comparables).
    4.  Apply the benchmark multiple to the target company's relevant financial metric (e.g., EPS, EBITDA, Sales) to estimate its value.
*   **Pros:** Reflects current market sentiment, relatively simple to apply if good comparables exist.
*   **Cons:** Finding truly comparable companies can be difficult, market multiples can be volatile and affected by short-term sentiment, doesn't account for company-specific factors as well as DCF.

**C. Precedent Transaction Analysis (Transaction Multiples):**
*   Similar to comparable company analysis, but uses multiples derived from recent acquisitions of similar companies.

Often, a combination of these methods (and others) is used to arrive at a valuation range.

## 6. Working Capital Management

Working capital management involves managing a firm's short-term assets (current assets) and short-term liabilities (current liabilities) to ensure it has sufficient liquidity to meet its day-to-day operating expenses and short-term debt obligations.
*   **Net Working Capital (NWC):** `Current Assets - Current Liabilities`
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Cash Management:** Ensuring sufficient cash on hand for operations while minimizing idle (non-earning) cash. Involves cash budgeting, managing collections and disbursements.
    *   **Accounts Receivable Management:** Setting credit policies, monitoring collections, minimizing bad debts. (Metrics: Days Sales Outstanding - DSO).
    *   **Inventory Management:** Optimizing inventory levels to meet demand without incurring excessive holding costs or risking obsolescence. (Metrics: Inventory Turnover, Days Inventory Held).
    *   **Accounts Payable Management:** Managing payments to suppliers, taking advantage of credit terms and early payment discounts where beneficial. (Metrics: Days Payable Outstanding - DPO).
*   **Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):** The time it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash flows from sales.
    `CCC = Days Inventory Outstanding + Days Sales Outstanding - Days Payable Outstanding`
    A shorter CCC is generally better, indicating more efficient working capital management.

## 7. Introduction to Financial Risk and Return & Capital Structure

*   **Risk and Return Trade-off:** A fundamental concept in finance stating that higher returns are generally associated with higher risk. Investors require compensation for taking on additional risk.
    *   *Risk* can be measured by the variability of returns (e.g., standard deviation).
    *   *Systematic Risk (Market Risk):* Risk inherent to the entire market or market segment (e.g., economic recessions, interest rate changes). Cannot be eliminated through diversification. Measured by Beta in CAPM.
    *   *Unsystematic Risk (Specific Risk):* Risk specific to an individual company or industry (e.g., a strike, product recall). Can be reduced or eliminated through diversification.
*   **Capital Structure:** The specific mix of long-term debt and equity a company uses to finance its assets and operations.
    *   **Optimal Capital Structure:** The mix of debt and equity that maximizes the firm's value (or minimizes its WACC).
    *   **Trade-offs:**
        *   *Debt:* Provides tax benefits (interest tax shield) but increases financial risk (risk of default/bankruptcy).
        *   *Equity:* Less risky (no fixed payments) but generally more expensive than debt and dilutes ownership.
    *   Theories like the Trade-Off Theory and Pecking Order Theory attempt to explain how firms choose their capital structures. This is a more advanced topic within corporate finance.
